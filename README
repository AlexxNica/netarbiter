| Overview |
+----------+
NetArbiter is a framwork that can stitche multiple OpenStack clusters and emulate network delay and bandwidth between them.

For details, see https://github.com/att/netarbiter/blob/master/netarbiter.pdf.

+--------------+
| Prerequisite |
+--------------+
1.For Ubuntu Linux:
# apt-get install ansible
For Mac OS X:
# brew install ansible

2. Add your private key (e.g., id_rsa.pub) to each server's authorized_keys.

0. Setup
- Store all hosts' domain names (or IP addresses) to an inventory file "all"
- Create an inventory file for each link between two sites. 
 This file is for route-create.yml and route-destroy.yml

1. Create/destroy a qrouter (and an ovs bridge)in a host
$ ansible-playbook -K -i hosts/all qrouter-create.yml -e HOST=<hostname> 
$ ansible-playbook -K -i hosts/all qrouter-destroy.yml -e HOST=<hostname> 

2. Create/destroy routes (and tunnels) to connect two sites 
$ ansible-playbook -K -i hosts/<inventory> route-create.yml
$ ansible-playbook -K -i hosts/<inventory> route-destroy.yml

3. Create delay, rate, and ceil with tc/netem
$ ansible-playbook -K -i hosts/<inventory> netemu-create.yml [-e DELAY=<delay> -e RATE=<rate> CEIL=<ceil>]
$ ansible-playbook -K -i hosts/<inventory> netemu-destroy.yml [-e DELAY=<delay> -e RATE=<rate> CEIL=<ceil>]
NOTE:
 - Delay and bandwidth are configured in each link's inventroy file. 
 - Refer to tc manual(i.e., $ man tc) for the units of <delay>, <rate>, and <ceil>
